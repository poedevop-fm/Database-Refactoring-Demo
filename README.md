# Database-Refactoring-Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of how to use triggers to refactor a SQL Server database.

Include is a Powershell presentation, along with demo SQL Server scripts for scenerios.

It includes a full blown presentatin (incomplete), along with a 10-minute mini-presentation, which I gave to TRIPASS in April 2016.
